CAPSTONE PROJECT ASSIGNMENT
Date: 03/08/2024
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
The goal of this capstone project is to design, implement, and simulate a secure and scalable network infrastructure for the Per Scholas Greater Boston campus. Leveraging Cisco Packet Tracer, a robust network simulation tool, this project aims to address the specific challenges and requirements of the Per Scholas campus, ensuring seamless communication, advanced technology integration, and enhanced security through the Three-Tier Hierarchical Network Model.
2. MOTIVATION
As Per Scholas Greater Boston continues to evolve in the digital landscape, and there is a critical need for a reliable and secure network infrastructure to support educational and administrative activities. This project is motivated by the commitment to provide Per Scholas with a blueprint for a network that balances innovation, scalability, and security within a single architecture.
3. PROJECT SCOPE
The project encompasses the entire network design life cycle, starting from initial planning and conceptualization to thorough network device configuration. It includes aspects such as routing and switching protocols, security measures, LAN and WAN connectivity, VoIP integration, IoT services, various server configurations, and VPN connectivity.
4. NETWORK DESIGN ARCHITECTURE FOR PER SCHOLAS GREATER BOSTON CAMPUS
For this project, the Three-Tier Hierarchical Network topology is the preferred choice for creating a robust, scalable, and cost-effective network infrastructure for Per Scholas Greater Boston campus. This industry-wide best practice provides a structured approach to network design, ensuring dependability and efficient scalability.
Hierarchical Topology Overview:
The Three-Tier Hierarchical Network Model is organized into three distinct layers: Access Layer, Distribution Layer, and Core Layer. Each layer serves specific functions and responsibilities, contributing to the overall efficiency and security of the network.
Figure 1: Three-Tier Hierarchical Network
Submission Guidelines:
• Clearly outline the Three-Tier Hierarchical Network Model in your network design.
• Explain the rationale behind the placement and configuration of devices in each layer.
• Detail the security measures implemented at each layer and throughout the network.
• Provide a comprehensive explanation of how your design addresses scalability and future expansion.
This instruction aims to guide you in creating a network architecture that not only adheres to industry best practices but also addresses the specific needs of Per Scholas Greater Boston campus. Your design should reflect a balance between dependability, scalability, and security.
5. METHODOLOGY
Your strategy should include a multi-step methodology, starting with conceptualizing the network's hierarchical structure and then setting up and linking devices across the Access, Distribution, and Core layers. Methodically organize IP address allocation and subnetting to meet the network’s capacity and functional requirements. Integrate the DMZ, Inside, and Outside zones strategically, applying security rules, perimeter defense mechanisms, and communication gateways.
Use the wide area network to establish a secure VPN tunnel between different local area networks. Cisco Packet Tracer will be the preferred tool for creating, iterating, and scrutinizing network situations within a controlled virtual environment.
6. SUBMISSION
Submit the comprehensive network design architecture, configurations, and simulation results using Cisco Packet Tracer. Include detailed explanations of your design choices, security measures, and scalability considerations.
7. PROJECT DEADLINE
The deadline for submitting this project would be on ____________________.
In summary, this project will not only demonstrate your understanding of network essentials but also provide Per Scholas Greater Boston with a practical and implementable network blueprint for future enhancements.
